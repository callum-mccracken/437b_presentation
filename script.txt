TITLE SLIDE

Hello everyone, thanks for coming! I'm Callum. we'll start off with a few slides that are pretty similar to my 437A talk, to get everyone up to speed.

INTRO SLIDE
[pictures of ATLAS, SM particles]

There are a good number of other particle people in this section, so I think it's somewhat safe to assume most folks here know about the large hadron collider, and that ATLAS is one of the main general-purpose detectors there. That's the image up there on the left. Protons smash together in the middle there, and ATLAS measures just about everything that comes out. I also think it's safe to assume that we've all at least vaguely heard of the Higgs field, which is responsible for particle mases. Excitations of the Higgs field are called Higgs bosons, Higgses are one of the fundamental particles in the standard model, shown on the right. Higgs physics is interesting to study for a couple reasons. For one, understanding mass on a deeper level may help make links with gravitational physics and dark matter searches.
Also, Higgs research is a bit of a frontier i.e. it is not super well constrained yet, and who knows what we might find?


MEASURING THE HIGGS SELF-COUPLING

You may be somewhat less familiar with the particular bit of the standard model concerned with modelling the Higgs field though. The V(phi) equation there shows the Higgs potential which looks like a sombrero, and if we Taylor expand around the minimum, we find this V_T potential, which is what we observe. The first two terms there can be removed using a change of coordinates, but the other two terms correspond to physically measurable processes. One current challenge in the field is to constrain the phi-cubed term, which corresponds to a three-pronged interaction like we can see in the Feynman diagram here.
